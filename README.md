# Educational Technology Plan

The goal is that students gain fundamental understanding of how computers operate. This includes understanding the difference between hardware and software and beginning to code (Scratch and some Python). To accomplish this formative assessments must be taken to understand where the majority of the cohort is (Google Survey). From there the ISTE standards can be incorporated and modified according to the class results. 

## Context

This course will focus on 7th grade Computer Science. 
### Course

Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level

Currently, I teach in Davis Joint Unified School district, and will be focusing on my 7th grade students to ensure I can provide fundamental knowledge and adequate resources that they can use as a tool later on in their academic journey. Computer Arts is offerred quarter long to our 7th grade students. They have a computer lab with 32 desktops and post/in pandemic they also carry their own chromebooks to use for their other classes. Students who come into the Computer Lab are working on Dell computers whereas their personal computers are all Chromebook. However, in our class, they only use the lab computers. Students also have Lego Mindstorm and VEX IQ robots however we have not gotten a chance to use them as my first year teaching, we went into the pandemic. I would like to implement the robots and understand how to code them online. 

### Situation

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?


Majority of the 7th grade students are famililar with how to use a computer however do not have some of the software programs at home. Reflecting on my previous classes, it seems that either the students have a fair amount of knowledge and expertise from past experiences, and there are students who are new to learning about Computer Science. Thus, this divide guides me to the middle and begin with students on Google Drive and then working our way towards Scratch and then Python. I do make an effort, to give students who are confident in their abilities an opporunity to help others that do need extra support for two reasons, 

1. It offers them a challenge to think critically and trouble shoot
2. Offers an environment where students are learning from each other rather than 
3. Helps build rapport with their peers
4. The 7th grade classes often stay together with their cohorts, so it is my hope that I am able to foster a caring environment rather than competition or judgemental based.

Each year we (the electives department) are allotted $1000 for the students without including any software programs that I seek. So far, students have access to the 2017 Adobe Suite and Tynker. Students also have drawing pads with pencils and headphones. Students are familiar with Google Drive and Canvas, our grading/online platform. Although teachers use Q for grading purposes and attendance students do not engage with that at all. The school district does block sites such as Netflix, Hulu, and gaming sites from the computer and the computers are antivirus protected. 

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.

Technology is power tool that is embedded into our 21st century lifestyles. It has the capability of supporting students and helping them become future engineers of computer science. During the COVID-19 pandemic, students accross the nation had to quickly adapt and continue their education away from home. It became the only linking point to academia and how familiar and comfortable with using a computer became either do-able or un-bearable. Teaching in the pandemic I realized students whose first language was not English had a more difficult time transitioning. On the contrary, the internet also provides resources that otherwise may not be readily available such the ability to translate languages or change the settings to accomodate to the language. When technology is used effectively it cn help minimize the opportunity gap by allowing students to be challenged and/or students who may need more supports to have the option of audio listening to a book, highlight changing the reading level, etc. As we continue forward in our touch screen reality, face recognizition sytems, touch screen refrigerators, self driving cars,  I am determined that technology willl be a part of our future. The more students are are given opportunities to interact with Computer Science at a younger age, the more they will have fundamental knowledge to opening up possible doors.
