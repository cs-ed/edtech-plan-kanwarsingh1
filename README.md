# Educational Technology Plan

The goal is that students gain fundamental understanding of how computers operate. This includes understanding the difference between hardware and software and beginning to code (Scratch). To accomplish this formative assessments must be taken to understand where the majority of the cohort is (Google Survey). From there the ISTE standards can be incorporated and modified according to the class results. The primary ISTE standard that will be emphasized in this edTech plan is 
ISTE standard 5.4.a Design CT activities where data can be obtained, analyzed and represented to support problem-solving and learning in other content areas. (https://www.iste.org/standards/iste-standards-for-computational-thinking) 


## Context

This course will focus on 7th grade Computer Science elective course. The course is comprised of all experiences of Computers and available to all students at our school who are not taking a language or music. Students take this course for 10 weeks and then rotate to their next elective. Since students come in with different expertise an effort is made to give all students challenging cirriculum at their pace so that they grow academically. For example, for when we work on Scratch or code.org students may choose to produce a more complex code or try working on an additional project. 

### Course



Currently, I teach in Davis Joint Unified School district, and will be focusing on my 7th grade students to ensure I can provide fundamental knowledge and adequate resources that they can use as a tool later on in their academic journey. Computer Arts is offerred quarter long to our 7th grade students. They have a computer lab with 32 desktops and post/in pandemic they also carry their own chromebooks to use for their other classes. Students who come into the Computer Lab are working on Dell computers whereas their personal computers are all Chromebook. However, in our class, they only use the lab computers. Students also have Lego Mindstorm and VEX IQ robots however we have not gotten a chance to use them as my first year teaching, we went into the pandemic. This class objectives would include learning about Google Drive (docs, sheets, sites, slides and forms), profiency in binary numbers and practice with computational thinking, and basic programming through block based coding on Scratch and code.org. Students will be able to check for updates. Students will successfully learn how to navigate Google Chrome to research different academic topics, learn to open new tabs and windows and other key functions by using keyboard shortcuts. Along the course students will be able to increase their typing speed. I would like to implement the robots and understand how to code them online. The primary focus is on the 7th grade Computer Science class learning how to use Scratch.


### Situation



Majority of the 7th grade students are famililar with how to use a computer however do not have some of the software programs at home. Reflecting on my previous classes, it seems that either the students have a fair amount of knowledge and expertise from past experiences, and there are students who are new to learning about Computer Science. Thus, this divide guides me to the middle and begin with students on Google Drive and then working our way towards Scratch. I do make an effort, to give students who are confident in their abilities an opporunity to help others that do need extra support for the following reasons, 

1. It offers them a challenge to think critically and trouble shoot
2. Offers an environment where students are learning from each other rather than 
3. Helps build rapport with their peers
4. The 7th grade classes often stay together with their cohorts, so it is my hope that I am able to foster a caring environment rather than competition or judgemental based.

Each year we (the electives department) are allotted $1000 for the students without including any software programs that I seek. So far, students have access to the 2017 Adobe Suite and Tynker. Students also have drawing pads with pencils and headphones. Students are familiar with Google Drive and Canvas, our grading/online platform. Although teachers use Q for grading purposes and attendance students do not engage with that at all. The school district does block sites such as Netflix, Hulu, and gaming sites from the computer and the computers are antivirus protected. 

The situational environment also includes 

## Plan

The lesson plan begins with showing studends how to sign up for Scratch. Then students will watch tutorials using the Explore. Students will then begin to work on "Animating your name" tutorial. Students will gradually move onto creating a maze game and frogger. 


### Software Specifications

Students do have access to installed software applications such as the Adobe Suite Creative Cloud, Microsoft - Word and Excel, Chrome, and Edge. 
The software the students will be using is Scratch. This is not installed on the desktops, thus students will have to log in using Chrome browsers. They will use their school email accounts to register and begin watching tutorials and exploring other Scratch projects that have been made public. Students will then move onto working on creating their own projects. Direct instruction will include a model for them to follow and offer sample codes. If students are less familiar they can work in a group and for those that are advanced can generate thier own code. 


### Hardware Specifications 


All students will beed their computors, monitors, mouse, keyboards and can use headphones if they choose to (for sound purposes). The specifics are as follow:
Windows 10 Enterprise
16GB
Intel(R)
i5-6500 CPU @ 3.20 GHz
Storage Capacity - 379 GB left and 191 used


### Application


Utilizing the resources in class, students will have access to everything they need in order to construct their Scratch projects. In class activity will include an "I do, we do, you do" model and will follow with guided instruction until the majority of the class gets more comfortable. Students will then switch to working more and more independently. Evidence based practices will include providing a low stress environment and scaffolding opportunities as students will have the option to work together and the due dates can be adjusted by 2 days (Schulte-Korne, 2016).

### Impacts


Technology is power tool that is embedded into our 21st century lifestyles. It has the capability of supporting students and helping them become future engineers of computer science. During the COVID-19 pandemic, students accross the nation had to quickly adapt and continue their education away from home. It became the only linking point to academia and how familiar and comfortable with using a computer became either do-able or un-bearable. Teaching in the pandemic I realized students whose first language was not English had a more difficult time transitioning. On the contrary, the internet also provides resources that otherwise may not be readily available such the ability to translate languages or change the settings to accomodate to the language. When technology is used effectively it cn help minimize the opportunity gap by allowing students to be challenged and/or students who may need more supports to have the option of audio listening to a book, highlight changing the reading level, etc. As we continue forward in our touch screen reality, face recognizition sytems, touch screen refrigerators, self driving cars,  I am determined that technology willl be a part of our future. The more students are are given opportunities to interact with Computer Science at a younger age, the more they will have fundamental knowledge to opening up possible doors.
